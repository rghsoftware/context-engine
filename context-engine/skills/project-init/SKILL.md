# Skill: Project Initialization Templates

## Purpose
Provides all template content needed by the `/context-engine:init` command.
This skill is not invoked directly — it's a reference library.

## Templates

### shared-conventions.md (always created, no paths frontmatter)

```markdown
# Shared Conventions

These conventions apply to all code regardless of stack.

## Git
- Conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, build, ci
- Commit messages reference task numbers: `Tasks: S001, S002`
- Commit messages reference ADRs when applicable: `ADR-0003`
- One logical change per commit — don't mix unrelated changes
- Planning artifacts (Context/) committed separately from source code

## Code Organization
- One responsibility per file — if a file does two unrelated things, split it
- Public API surface should be minimal — don't export internals
- Dead code gets deleted, not commented out (git has history)
- No secrets in source code — use environment variables or secret managers

## Documentation
- Public functions/methods get documentation comments
- Complex algorithms get inline comments explaining *why*, not *what*
- README.md at project root covers setup, build, and run instructions
- Architecture decisions go in Context/Decisions/ as ADRs

## Planning Workflow
- Features use the 4-phase workflow: Spec → Tech → Steps → Implementation
- Small tasks use quick plans
- Every deviation from spec gets an ADR
- Milestone checkpoints verify alignment with Testable Assertions
- Test and documentation tasks are planned, not afterthoughts

## Error Messages
- Error messages should help the user fix the problem
- Include what went wrong, what was expected, and what to try
- Never expose internal stack traces to end users
- Log the full error context for debugging
```

### python-fastapi.md

Frontmatter (substitute real directory):
```yaml
---
paths:
  - "[detected-python-dir]/**"
  - "**/*.py"
---
```

```markdown
# Python/FastAPI Conventions

## Language & Runtime
- Python 3.11+ required
- Type annotations on all public function signatures
- `from __future__ import annotations` at top of every module

## Code Style
- Formatter: ruff format
- Linter: ruff check
- Line length: 88 (ruff default)
- Import sorting: ruff isort rules (stdlib → third-party → local)
- Docstrings: Google style on all public functions and classes

## FastAPI Patterns
- All endpoints must declare `response_model`
- Use dependency injection for database sessions, config, and auth
- Async endpoints must actually await something — use `def` for sync operations
- Pydantic v2: use `model_config` dict, not `class Config`
- Error responses via `HTTPException` with explicit status codes
- Request validation via Pydantic models, not manual parsing

## Database
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 style with `select()` statements, not legacy `query()`
- Alembic for migrations — never modify database schema outside migrations
- All queries parameterized — no string formatting for SQL

## Testing
- Framework: pytest with httpx AsyncClient
- Test files: `test_[module].py` in a `tests/` directory mirroring source structure
- Fixtures for database setup/teardown
- Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` for edge case coverage
- Async tests: use `@pytest.mark.anyio` or `pytest-asyncio`

## Error Handling
- Never bare `except:` — always specify exception type
- Log exceptions with structured context before re-raising
- Use custom exception classes for domain-specific errors
- `try/except` blocks should be as narrow as possible
```

### vue-typescript.md

Frontmatter (substitute real directory):
```yaml
---
paths:
  - "[detected-vue-dir]/**"
  - "**/*.vue"
  - "**/*.ts"
  - "**/*.tsx"
---
```

```markdown
# Vue.js/TypeScript Conventions

## Language & Framework
- Vue 3 with Composition API (`<script setup>` preferred)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- No Options API in new code

## Code Style
- Formatter: prettier
- Linter: eslint with @vue/eslint-config-typescript
- Component naming: PascalCase for files and usage
- Composables: `use[Name].ts` prefix, return typed objects

## Component Patterns
- Props: `defineProps<{}>()` with TypeScript interface
- Emits: `defineEmits<{}>()` with typed events
- State: `ref()` for primitives, `reactive()` for objects
- Computed: `computed()` for derived state, never side effects
- Watchers: `watch()` / `watchEffect()` with cleanup when needed
- Template refs: `useTemplateRef()` with typed ref

## State Management
- Pinia for global state
- Stores: `defineStore()` with setup syntax (composable-style)
- No direct store mutation from components — use store actions
- Keep stores focused — split by domain, not by page

## Styling
- Tailwind CSS utility classes preferred
- Scoped styles (`<style scoped>`) when Tailwind isn't sufficient
- No inline styles except for truly dynamic values

## Testing
- Framework: Vitest + Vue Test Utils
- Test files: `[Component].test.ts` colocated with component
- Mount components with `mount()` or `shallowMount()`
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Mock API calls, don't hit real endpoints

## Accessibility
- All images need `alt` attributes
- Interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Icon-only buttons need `aria-label`
- Form inputs need associated labels
- Color is never the sole indicator of state
```

### rust-tauri.md

Frontmatter (substitute real directory):
```yaml
---
paths:
  - "[detected-rust-dir]/**"
  - "**/*.rs"
---
```

```markdown
# Rust/Tauri Conventions

## Language
- Rust stable channel (latest)
- Edition 2021
- Clippy: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` must pass

## Code Style
- Formatter: rustfmt (default configuration)
- `use` imports: grouped by std → external crates → internal modules
- Error types: `thiserror` for library errors, `anyhow` for application errors
- Naming: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for types, SCREAMING_SNAKE for constants

## Patterns
- Prefer `?` operator over `unwrap()` in application code
- `unwrap()` acceptable in tests and after explicit validation
- Every `unsafe` block must have a `// SAFETY:` comment explaining the invariant
- `clone()` on large types needs a comment justifying it
- Prefer iterators over indexed loops
- Use `#[must_use]` on functions where ignoring the return value is likely a bug

## Tauri-Specific
- All `#[tauri::command]` handlers must validate inputs before processing
- Capability permissions: least-privilege — request only what's needed
- IPC: return `Result<T, String>` from commands for proper error propagation
- State: use `tauri::State<>` for shared state, not global statics
- Windows: scope file system access to app directories
- CSP: configure in `tauri.conf.json`, no `unsafe-inline` for scripts

## Async
- Tokio runtime for async operations
- Never block inside async functions
- `JoinHandle` errors must be handled
- Use `tokio::select!` for concurrent operations with cancellation

## Testing
- Unit tests: `#[cfg(test)]` module in each source file
- Integration tests: `tests/` directory at crate root
- Mock external dependencies — don't hit real APIs in tests
```

### embedded-c.md

Frontmatter (substitute real directory):
```yaml
---
paths:
  - "[detected-firmware-dir]/**"
  - "**/*.c"
  - "**/*.h"
---
```

```markdown
# Embedded C/C++ Conventions (ESP32 / RP2350)

## Language
- C11 for core firmware, C++17 where C++ is used
- No dynamic allocation in ISR context
- All buffers must have compile-time bounds

## Code Style
- Formatter: clang-format
- Types: `stdint.h` exclusively (`uint32_t`, not `unsigned long`)
- Naming: snake_case for functions/variables, ALL_CAPS for macros and constants
- Header guards: `#pragma once` or traditional `#ifndef` guards
- One function per responsibility — keep functions under 50 lines where practical

## Memory Safety
- No `malloc`/`free` in interrupt handlers
- `snprintf` over `sprintf`, `strncpy` over `strcpy` — always
- Stack sizes explicitly set per FreeRTOS task
- Use `uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark()` in debug builds to verify stack sizing
- No VLAs (variable-length arrays) — use fixed buffers

## Interrupt Safety — ESP32
- ISR functions must be `IRAM_ATTR`
- Shared variables: `volatile` + `portMUX_TYPE` spinlock
- Use `taskENTER_CRITICAL_ISR` / `taskEXIT_CRITICAL_ISR` in ISR context
- Keep critical sections minimal — no FreeRTOS API calls inside
- Use `FromISR` variants of FreeRTOS functions in ISR context

## Interrupt Safety — RP2350
- `critical_section_enter()` / `critical_section_exit()` must be paired
- Multicore shared data protected by mutex
- PIO programs: instruction count must not exceed 32

## FreeRTOS Patterns
- Task creation: always specify stack size based on measured requirements
- Queue operations: always use timeout, never infinite wait in production
- Semaphores: prefer counting semaphores for resource pools
- No `vTaskDelay(0)` — use `taskYIELD()` for clarity

## Testing
- Framework: Unity test framework for logic modules
- Mock HAL layer for hardware abstraction testing
- Test on host (native) where possible, target for hardware-specific behavior

## Build
- CMake-based build system (ESP-IDF or Pico SDK)
- Warnings as errors: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
- Static analysis: cppcheck as part of CI
```

### kotlin-multiplatform.md

Frontmatter (substitute real directory):
```yaml
---
paths:
  - "[detected-kotlin-dir]/**"
  - "**/*.kt"
  - "**/*.kts"
---
```

```markdown
# Kotlin Multiplatform Conventions

## Language
- Kotlin 2.0+ with K2 compiler
- Explicit API mode for library modules
- Coroutines for all async operations

## Code Style
- Formatter: ktlint
- Linter: detekt with compose rules plugin (if Compose is used)
- Naming: camelCase for functions/properties, PascalCase for classes, SCREAMING_SNAKE for constants
- Prefer `val` over `var` — mutability must be justified
- Use data classes for pure data, sealed classes for state hierarchies

## Coroutines
- Structured concurrency: never use `GlobalScope`
- `SupervisorJob` in scopes where child failure should be isolated
- `CoroutineExceptionHandler` at scope boundaries
- Never use `Dispatchers.Main` in `commonMain`
- Always catch `CancellationException` separately or don't catch `Exception` broadly

## Compose (if applicable)
- Stateless composables preferred — hoist state to caller
- All public composables accept a `Modifier` parameter
- Side effects: `LaunchedEffect`, `SideEffect`, `DisposableEffect` only
- Remember: always use `remember` with `mutableStateOf`

## Kotlin Multiplatform
- Maximum logic in `commonMain` — `expect/actual` for platform APIs only
- Keep `actual` implementations thin
- Use `kotlinx-datetime` for dates, `kotlinx-serialization` for JSON
- DI: Koin with `verify()` in tests

## Testing
- Framework: kotlin.test + JUnit5 (JVM) + XCTest bridge (iOS)
- Test shared logic in `commonTest`
- Platform-specific tests only for `actual` implementations
- Test coroutines with `runTest` and `TestDispatcher`

## Error Handling
- Sealed class hierarchies for domain errors
- `Result<T>` for operations that can fail predictably
- Never swallow exceptions silently
- `require()` / `check()` for preconditions
```
